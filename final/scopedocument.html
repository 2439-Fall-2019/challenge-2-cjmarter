	  <h1>Scope Document</h1>
	  <p>The scope of my website will be to present information about four musical genres and three of their subgenres each. Each genre and subgenre will have a summary of their general releveancy and history. Under these summaries will be a list of three artists and one of each of their releases. These releases will have their release dates, names, and track lists fully documented. There will be at least one music video present on the site and each genre will have an overarching picture to accompany it. A survey will be present as to allow users to provide feedback on the website so that it can be improved. The wireframe used to plan the website layout will also be accesible to users, as well as a credits page as to provide proper credits.</p>
      <h1>Usability Tests</h1>
<h2>Test #1</h2>
<p>The user generally viewed the music-based tabs first. They stopped to read some summaries and mostly avoided the credits/wireframe tabs.<br>I gave this user the task of locating the "Freak Folk" music genre. They found it quickly through the "Folk" tab with little frustration.<br>The user suggested that I change my fonts to make the site more visually appealing to users. They also suggested that I add more content.</p>
<h2>Test #2</h2>
<p>The user was interested in what was contained in the wireframes and credits tabs but quickly became bored and began to view the music tabs.<br>I gave this user the task of locating a video, which took them a small amount of time. There was little frustration involved however they did find it on the last tab they clicked on.<br>They suggested that I make it more clear where videos/pictures were located on the website so they did not have to search specifically for them.</p>
<h2>Summary of Usability Tests</h2>
<p>The general gist of the usability tests was that the site is relatively straightforward and easy to use. Users did not struggle to locate the most important tabs and information and were mostly disinterested in the credits and wireframes. They managed to find the videos and images that they wanted to seek out without trouble or difficulty.</p>
